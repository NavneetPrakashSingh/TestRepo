Kids, Young Adults and Classics, told the Journal that families with children canceled their service at a lower rate than households without them.One of the ways they compete in that realm is by capitalizing on hit shows like \"CoComelon\" and bringing them on to their streaming platforms. Streaming giants are trying to figure out what kind of content will attract these youth viewers, a demographic that's key to securing and retaining subscribers. Nielsen data on Netflix's streaming viewership showed that viewers 2- to 11 years old made up 21% of its audience in September. \"In just the first half of 2023, \"CoComelon,\" and its six seasons currently on Netflix, were watched for 601 million hours, Business Insider senior correspondent Katie Notopoulos noted.
