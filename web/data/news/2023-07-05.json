The retail margin on a core $250 Saturn system, without pack-in games, was 6 percent, or $15, while Sony seemed to be offering 10 percent core, 15 percent pack-in. Enthusiasts and historians can see the costs, margins, and sales of every Sega system sold in America by 1997 in detailed business plan spreadsheets. And you can read Kalinske's notes to marketing head Neil Cohen demanding 50 percent of the ad be game footage and asking, \"When did we decide on Hare Krishna cult members?\" Strategies included \"position Saturn as the technically superior next generation system,\" \"leverage exclusive Saturn peripherals,\" and \"strengthen sports line-up and ship titles concurrent with season. The answer, according to Sega, is that it was perceived to be cheaper, its software \"looks better than ours,\" that Sega \"equity has been damaged by 32x and Sega CD,\" and that Sony has \"effectively leveraged their considerable equity from consumer electronics.\" Sega's Wikipedia page will likely be overhauled with the information contained in inter-departmental emails, like the one where CEO Tom Kalinske assures staff (and perhaps himself) that \"we are killing Sony\" in Japan in March 1996.",

Today, a startup called CADDi, which operates a business-to-business (B2B) marketplace for the manufacturing industry, said it has raised $89 million in a Series C round, bringing its total capital to $164 million, to scale its business and help those equipment manufacturing players. CADDi Drawer offers access to all procurement data and details that impact quality, cost and delivery (QCD); its platform also enables users to save significant time and costs while allowing manufacturers to improve QCD with more drawings created. So, instead of more drawings providing more improvement, its almost like the data is never saved, and people are forced to start from scratch every time. CADDi claims it works with 70% of Japans top 20 industrial equipment manufacturers (by revenue) for CADDi Manufacturing. It will use the proceeds to enhance CADDi manufacturing and CADDi Drawing and expand its workforce in the U.S., aiming to reach its goals of posting $10 billion in revenue from CADDi manufacturing and $1 billion in revenue from CADDi Drawer by 2030. Some of the pains in the procurement industry in the U.S. are similar to those in Japan, Kato said, citing not only labor shortages in the manufacturing sector but also many ongoing mergers and acquisitions. Because of the difficulty of access [drawings], drawings are often recreated or just not found, which means keys to improving QCD, the KPI for manufacturing professionals, are never unlocked, Kato said.",
