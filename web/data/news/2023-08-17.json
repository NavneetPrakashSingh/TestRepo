Why it matters: For most of the last two decades, Chinas economic growth has been a major driver of the global economy, said Alex Etra, a strategist at data analytics firm Exante. Funds are already retreating: US private equity and venture capital investments in the country hit an eight-year low last year and continue to fall, according to data from PitchBook. Separately, a Congressional committee announced earlier this month that it is investigating BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager, and MSCI, one of the biggest providers of index funds, to determine whether they are investing in Chinese companies blacklisted by the US government for security and human rights issues. Large hedge funds like Michael Burrys Scion Asset Management, Moore Capital Management, Coatue, D1 Capital and Tiger Global also cut their exposure to Chinese companies in the second quarter of 2023, according to recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings. And some of that has to do with direct exposure of US companies sales in China and with China being a major consumer of commodities.
