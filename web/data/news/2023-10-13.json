This was the company's fourth suborbital spaceflight with paying customers aboard, maintaining a monthly flight rate since Virgin Galactic's air-launched rocket plane started commercial service in late June. A small vertical-takeoff, vertical-landing rocket originally built by Masten Space Systems has resumed flights under the management of Astrobotic, which purchased the assets of bankrupt Masten last year, Space News reports. The liquid-fueled rocket was to reach an altitude of 80 kilometers, and PLD Space intended to recover the rocket and payload from the sea. Production of the basic version of Vega is being discontinued in favor of the larger Vega C, which remains grounded until late 2024 to allow for a redesign of its second-stage nozzle.An international mission ...

            "summary": "The White House has selected the Philadelphia area and West Virginia for two regional hubs to produce and deliver hydrogen fuel, an important part of the Biden administrations clean energy plan, according to a person familiar with the plan. The intent is to accelerate the availability and use of the colorless, odorless gas that already powers some vehicles and trains.Among those selected were the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, based in West Virginia, and the Philadelphia-based Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub. The hub plans to use renewable energy, natural gas and nuclear energy.The Pacific Northwest hub, based in eastern Washington, will extend to Oregon and Montana and will use hydropower and other renewable resources to produce clean hydrogen. West Virginia will be on the leading edge of building out the new hydrogen market.'The Appalachian hub will extend to Ohio and includes a $1.6 billion facility under construction in northern Pennsylvania that is working to produce near-zero emissions hydrogen from natural gas. Gavin Newsom said Friday.The Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub will be centered in Houston, long the energy capital of the U.S., and plans large-scale hydrogen production from both natural gas and renewables. Big fossil fuel companies, renewable energy developers and researchers in university and government labs are involved, too.Environmental groups are skeptical, arguing that while hydrogen is a clean-burning source of power, it takes a great deal of energy to produce. Pennsylvania has projects in two separate hubs.The infrastructure law Biden signed in 2021 included billions of dollars to develop so-called clean hydrogen, a technology that industry and clean-energy advocates have long pushed as a way to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions produced by fossil fuels.",
