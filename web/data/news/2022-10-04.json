            "summary": "Derrick Palmer, the vice president of the Amazon Labor Union, said day-shift workers were sent home with pay due to the fire, which began late afternoon Monday. Amazon spokesperson Paul Flaningan said in a prepared statement that the company had asked all night shift employees to report to their shifts on Monday after the New York Fire Department certified the building as safe. The suspended workers were notified by email and phone that their security badges would be inactive during the duration of the probe, Palmer said. Seth Goldstein, an attorney for the union, said the workers intend to file unfair labor practice charges against Amazon with the National Labor Relations Board. While the vast majority of employees reported to their workstations, a small group refused to return to work and remained in the building without permission, Flaningan said. Eventually, roughly 100 workers held a sit-down protest at the facilitys main office, demanding to be sent home with pay. Meanwhile, warehouse workers at a separate facility near Albany, New York will be voting in their own union election next week.",
