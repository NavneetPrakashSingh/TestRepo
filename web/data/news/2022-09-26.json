Doug Johnson - Sep 26, 2022 7:05 pm UTC In the world of renewables, lithium-ion batteries are storage kings, making up around 70 percent of electric vehicle (EV) and 90 percent of grid batteries around the globe. Russia plays a key role in the worlds nickel supply, mining 21 percent of the worlds Class 1 nickel, which is pure enough for use in EV battery systems. For the United States, this might mean that the security of the supply chains for these batteries is put at risk by geopolitical conflicts. These lithium-ion chemistries avoid some of the problems seen with other typesLFP batteries, for instance, dont make use of cobalt, an expensive ingredient.
