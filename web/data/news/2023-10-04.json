The advance notice apparently came from a news release sent out early by mistake.Quantum dots are tiny inorganic particles that glow a range of colors from red to blue when exposed to light. But it wasnt until several decades later that scientists could manufacture quantum dots in a lab.In the 1980s, Ekimov, 78, and Brus, 80, honed the theory and developed early laboratory techniques for creating particles that emit varying colors by adjusting sizes. Bawendi said he was not thinking about the possible applications of his work when he started researching quantum dots. And thats what drives scientists and academic scientists to do what they do, he said.Brus, a professor emeritus at Columbia, said he didnt pick up the phone when the early morning call came from the Swedish academy to notify him.
