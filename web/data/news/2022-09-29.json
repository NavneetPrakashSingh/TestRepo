By using a technique called Fourier synthesis, we superposed many waves with different frequencies in such a way that there was only one minimum or one maximum depending on whether you apply positive or negative voltage, he said.Bauerle compares these concentrated sound waves to laser pulses. Like any wave, a sound wave takes a sinusoidal form, consisting of many maxima and minima, which makes it difficult to predict the location of the electron.Bauerle and his team have now gotten around this problem by engineering a wave that has a single minimum or a single maximum. This, along with the precise and controlled manner of electron transmission, enables us to manipulate the quantum information in real time. Since we have a focused acoustic pulse, we know exactly at what time the electron will arrive at a node, he said.Paulo Santos, a Berlin-based nanoelectronics expert from the Paul Drude Institute for Solid State Electronics, likens the technique to a surfer riding a wave. If you compare it to the photonic quantum system, the manipulations have to be done beforehand because information is transmitted at the speed of light, which is too fast for real-time manipulation,\" he said.Moreover, this technique can potentially be scaled up because of the large size of the waveform.",
