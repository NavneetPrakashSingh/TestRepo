Our data provides valuable insights not only to IT but across the C-suite  chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, chief customer officers and others.Stamford, Connecticutbased SponsorUnited  which isnt revealing revenue figures  expects to have 100 employees by the end of the year, Lynch added. Paired with previous investments from Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry and San Diego Padres co-owner Ron Fowler, the infusion brings the startups total raised to $38.6 million.Up to this point, SponsorUnited had raised minimal capital, preferring to stay lean while building our data capture infrastructure and platform, Lynch said. Lynch says hes tracking trends like sponsorships in the metaverse (to the extent theyre a thing), college athlete deals enabled by last years Supreme Court decision, and TikToks growing reach with younger audiences. For both brands and the recipients of sponsorships, the lack of data presents a challenge. We continue to invest in technology to scale and replicate the processes by which sponsorship data is tracked.So whats next for SponsorUnited? SponsorUnited today closed a $35 million Series A funding round led by Spectrum Equity at a postmoney valuation north of $100 million.",
