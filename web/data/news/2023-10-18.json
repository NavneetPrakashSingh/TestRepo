He talks about the economic frameworks that life is spun around, without mentioning the intricate ways it actually impacts people.Plenty of tech giants speak of creating a world they have no grasp on. Early on in his essay, Andreessen writes, We believe that there is no material problem  whether created by nature or by technology  that cannot be solved with more technology. A16z is increasingly investing in defense companies, including Palmer Luckeys controversial startup Anduril, which manufactures autonomous weapons. But to deny the negative impacts of these companies is to move through the world with blinders up.Furthermore, its implicit  but not stated in Andreessens argument  that these platforms have effectively made large swatches of society renters, and the platforms, the landlords. He wants 50 billion people to be on earth (and then for some of us to colonize outer space), and says the markets can generate the money needed to fund social welfare programs. What is missing here is that San Francisco is already the tech hub of the world and is one of the most unequal places in the universe, both socially and economically. So, he inherently is going to push for his techno-optimist vision, because the success of tech companies means he gets even more rich.",
