North Korea had also fired a short-range missile when the USS Ronald Reagan and its battle group arrived for joint drills with South Korea in September, which was the last time the United States sent an aircraft carrier to waters near the Korean Peninsula. Japan has previously used similar language to describe a North Korean solid-fuel missile apparently modeled after Russias Iskander mobile ballistic system, which is designed to be maneuverable in low-altitude flight to better evade South Korean missile defenses. Japans military said the missiles, which landed outside Japans exclusive economic zone, flew on an irregular trajectory and reached a maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (31 miles). The United States and South Korea completed their biggest springtime exercises in years last week, which had included both computer simulations and live-fire field exercises. North Korea, which has weathered tightened U.N. Security Council sanctions since 2016 over its nuclear developments, didnt immediately comment on the launches. The tests also included a purported nuclear-capable underwater drone that the North claimed can set off a huge radioactive tsunami and destroy naval vessels and ports.",
