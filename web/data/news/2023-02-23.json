He told private bankers that the $20 million, which amounted to 40% of the $50 million Slync raised from angels and venture firms, represented a distribution from my company  a distribution that Slyncs board of directors never authorized.Meanwhile, some of Slyncs staff went months without pay. But this infusion of funds is also an indication that our investment partners see the potential in Slyncs technology.So what is Slyncs technology?At a high level, Slync connects disparate shipping and logistics systems, ingesting and processing data to (ideally) automate various repetitive processes. Setting aside the fact that hiring might be a challenge, given the companys historical payroll issues, Slyncs latest funding tranche was only a fraction of the size of the previous, all-equity tranche  suggesting Kirchner casts a long shadow. During all this, the startup lost its chief marketing officer, chief revenue officer and chief financial officer.Understandably, Slync has made a concerted effort to distance itself from Kirchner  and its had some success, seemingly. We reached out to the company for more information, and Greg Kefer, the chief marketing officer, agreed to an email interview.Off the bat, Kefer refused to answer questions pertaining to Kirchner, save that he was suspended from his position as Slyncs CEO in 2022. According to filings with the SEC, Slync raised around $24 million  a combination of equity and debt  in January.",

This is just the beginning from Chain Reaction, as they make great strides in disrupting the traditional and complex market of data center, cloud, and through to edge computing hardware infrastructure. We saw the potential of combining experience and expertise in analog and system design with algorithms and cryptography to engineer the future of compute infrastructure. We may be the first movers but we think this is the next disruptive technology in the cloud, and you will see others. Blockchain is the key to securing democracy, decentralization, and freedom, but it is compute intensive. We have unique architecture and we also understand the limitations on compute and memory among processors today.",
