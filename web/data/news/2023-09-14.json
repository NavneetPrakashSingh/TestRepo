            "summary": "All three countries expressed grave concerns over the discussions between the two leaders, which included topics related to military cooperation, including the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), despite repeated warnings from the international community, the statement said. Asked if the two leaders discussed military and technical cooperation during the talks, Peskov said it was a sensitive sphere of cooperation and reiterated Moscows commitment to further developing ties with Pyongyang. The tour of key sites in the Russian Far East region came after Putin previously said Russia is considering and discussing some military cooperation with North Korea, following a summit at which Kim appeared to endorse Moscows war on Ukraine. We see the potential for cooperation both in aircraft manufacturing and in other industries  this is especially relevant for achieving the tasks our countries face to achieve technological sovereignty, he said. Russias Deputy Prime Minister, Denis Manturov, said after the tour that Moscow saw the potential for cooperation both in aircraft manufacturing and in other industries with North Korea, according to a Russian government press release Friday on its Telegram channel.  Vladimir Putin has said Russia will build good neighborly relations with North Korea on the fourth day of Kim Jong Uns lengthy visit to the country, amid warnings from the West that Moscow must not break international sanctions targeting Pyongyang. But he also said there were areas open for discussion and consideration, suggesting potential points of cooperation.",

President Joe Bidens aides privately acknowledge a rematch with Donald Trump in 2024 could be his best path to reelection, but they are terrified by what would happen if he lost  which operatives on his campaign and throughout the Democratic Party worry is a very real possibility. They are testing not just which voters the campaign is reaching and what the campaign is saying, but how the voters are being reached, how theyre processing the information  and whether any of that can be turned into votes. The reelection campaign is laying the groundwork for an argument that goes beyond Trump in case they instead face one of the three or four GOP candidates they still see as having a chance. As for Steyer, Tom believes the Biden administration has been one of the best in history on climate, and he will be enthusiastically supporting President Bidens re-election campaign, said adviser Doug Rubin. At the end of the day, money is not going to be a problem, said the famous trial lawyer, who is still waiting to firm up a Florida event he has been talking with the Biden campaign about hosting since the spring. Its a malaise about the president that operatives keep noting that goes beyond a slew of national polls  including one from CNN last week  that show a negative view of the presidents performance.",
